Simple File Server able to serve requests from client application:

  USAGE: server -p <port_number>

  Server is able to perform two operations - download, upload.
  Both operation has to be requested by client.

Simple Client capable of transferring files from and to local custom server

  Usage: client -h <hostname> -p <port> [-d|-u] <file>

  Client is functional only if server is running on inserted hostname and port.

Important: Server and client should not be executed within same folder.
If file is loaded on server it is stored in temporary file until it is
fully uploaded. Server should be able to provide one file to more clients
but it is tested only on two clients.
